# React Native Web


## Navigation

### React navigation

This is the library used in the Evolve Owner app. It allows us to navigate between screens in a React Native app. It is also compatible with React Native Web. but the web support is experimental.




### Expo Router

https://docs.expo.dev/routing/introduction/

Expo Router is an open-source routing library for Universal React Native applications built with Expo.

Expo Router is a file-based router for React Native and web applications. It allows you to manage navigation between screens in your app, allowing users to move seamlessly between different parts of your app's UI, using the same components on multiple platforms (Android, iOS, and web).

It brings the best file-system routing concepts from the web to a universal application — allowing your routing to work across every platform. When a file is added to the app directory, the file automatically becomes a route in your navigation.
